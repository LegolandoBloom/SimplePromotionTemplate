This is my way of giving back to the dev community, who have helped me massively when it came to learning addon development. Special thanks to Plusmouse, Numdelicious and Ghost always willing to answer my many silly questions! You can use this template to promote your other addons within an addon's UI Menus, I tried to make it as easy to use as possible. Check out the example included in the file to see how to use it!


(1) Only include SimplePromotionTemplate.xml in your TOC file, other is embedded inside it

(2) Change all appearances of 'YourAddon' inside both files to the name or nickname of your addon to avoid clashing with anyone else who might be using this

Example Addon1: YourAddon_SimplePromotionTooltip --> Addon1_SimplePromotionTooltip

(3) You can check out the 'exampleUsage.lua' to see how to use it!

(4) Do not forget to provide icon files when setting up!

(5) Clicking on the buttons will bring up a copy/paste edit box with your provided link inside it
